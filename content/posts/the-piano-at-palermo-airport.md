# Tidal wave of emotion
I watched the tv show ”[空港ピアノ「わが故郷　シチリア島」](https://hh.pid.nhk.or.jp/pidh07/ProgramIntro/Show.do?pkey=001-20180128-11-17047)”. It was time to leave work already but the tv show was very interesting and I watched the whole show.
[Palermo airport](http://www.gesap.it/en/) which is located on Sicily Island has a piano. Any traveler can play it, and every traveler around the piano can enjoy music. People listening to the music playing by Random people while they are waiting for an airplane, I really like that situation. Nobody knows who is playing and the player doesn't know people who are listening to. This situation happened at only this moment. Never happens at other time. Same player, same listeners, same music, it never happens.

And now, you can find piano in airport everywhere. This is good one in Amsterdam.
