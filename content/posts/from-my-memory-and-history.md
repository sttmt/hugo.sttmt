## 1/125 and f8?

I have tried to take photo like an old style photographer sometimes. It is too much complicated, shutter speed, aperture, exposure, develop film, make print, need to understand about some chemical things. sounds impossible to make them by myself but I have internet.
[Henri Caritier-Bresson](http://www.henricartierbresson.org/en/), he is one of the most famous photographer in the world. I can find some articles he usually takes photos f8 and 1/125 on the web.[^1] because taking photo is on many processes, and he fixed some conditions for more concentrate to only shutter timing. This is a good way to keep taking photo for long time. Keep simple, Keep doing.

## Films

Film maker Fujifilm will stop making black and white films in this year. Acros 100 which is popular film is the last one and will be die in October 2018.[^2] I need to find other cheap film before my film stock is out. Maybe from overseas?

### chemicals

I completely forget about chemicals for film developing, also don't have enough knowledge about printing. need more details.

### papers

I don't know how to print film as well, but Fujifilm's paper for printing will be dead according some news.
